# Medicine-Recommender-system
We proposed a Recommendation system for recommending medicine as per the conditions based on patient reviews. The project has proceeded with the following section. This proposed system consists of five modules: The Database module, the Data preparation module, the Recommendation model module, the Model evaluation module, and the Data visualization module. The next section is the Result, and the last section is the conclusion. The Medicine Recommender system can be a useful tool for doctors as well as patients.

 In future work, the efficiency of the recommender system can be increased by adding a gender attribute, age group attribute, and a location attribute. Also, we can consider the price of medicines.
